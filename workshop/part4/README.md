# Part 4: workshop conclusion

As the conclusion of the workshop we'll do a short exercise: each attendee will stand up and tell the group what was the 2 main things they learned from the workshop and one thing that was the most challenging part of the workshop.

Then, you can leave your email address if you want to fill the short anonymous feedback form and get the free ebook of the "Serverless applications with Node.js" book.
