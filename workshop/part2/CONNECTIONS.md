# Connections

But before you start, let's do a short connections exercise together!

During this connections exercise, you'll need to do two following actions:

- Table talk

## Table talk

The idea of table talk is to meet the other team members by trying to answer some of the topic related questions together. Don't worry, there are no wrong answers! And you'll learn more about all questions from the list in this part of the workshop.

Here are a few questions that your team should to try to answer to toghether:

- What's the easiest way to start with the React application?
- Is there some simple component library/UI theme that you can use?
- Is there any other framework that the team would use instead of React?
- Is there anything that would be problematic while connecting your React app to the backend you created?

Discuss the questions above with your group for a few minutes.
