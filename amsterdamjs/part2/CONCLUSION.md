# Conclusion

Awesome, you have a working app!

Here are the few tasks for you to do for the end of the second part of this workshop.

1. Table talk:
   - What are the most important concepts you learned from this part of the workshop? 
   - Does CORS work with your serverless app? If it does, do you know how does it work?
   - Did you learned anything that you will show to your friends/coworkers? If yes what was it?
   - What was the most complicated part of your task and why?
2. Stand and Deliver - demo the application and explain what was the most difficult part of the development.
