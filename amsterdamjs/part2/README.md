# Part 2: develop and deploy a frontend app

Once you finish the mock API, it's time to create a frontend application. As you still have a tight deadline, and building a frontend app is something your team already know how to do, you don't want to spend too much time working on it.

Your task is to build a quick and simple UI for your meetup app, and then to connect your frontend to the mock API you built in the previous part of the workshop.

At the moment you started working at the app, production-ready API was still not available. The external team has some difficulties, and it's behind the schedule.
