# Exercise 2: Create a Node.js project and install Claudia.js

In order to start creating the mock API, you'll need to initialize a Node.js project.

> Make sure you have Node.js version 6 or higher with NPM. In case you don't have it installed, get it from: https://nodejs.org/en/.

To initialize an empty Node.js project, create a new folder and run the following command in it and follow the instructions:

```bash
npm init
```

Let's call this Node.js project "meetup" project from now on.

## Claudia.js

Once you have a new Node.js project, make sure you install Claudia.js. For more info visit [claudiajs.com](https://claudiajs.com).
