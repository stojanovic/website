# Connections

But before you start, let's do a short connections exercise together!

During this connections exercise, you'll need to do two following actions:

- Table talk
- Stand and Deliver

## Table talk

The idea of table talk is to meet the other team members by trying to answer some of the topic related questions together. Don't worry, there are no wrong answers! And you'll learn more about all questions from the list in this part of the workshop.

Here are the four questions that your team should to try to answer to toghether:

- What are the two services we need for building a serverless API on AWS?
- List a few programming languages you can use to develop serverless apps on AWS.
- List four serverless deployment tools or frameworks.
- What is claudia.js?

Write a short answer to each of these questions.

## Stand and Deliver

Now that your team answered some or all of the questions, it's time to help the other teams. Pick one person that will stand up and answer one or two of these questions. Again, don't worry, there are no wrong answers, let's have some fun ðŸ˜Š

It was easy, right? Let's go on and do some real work now!
